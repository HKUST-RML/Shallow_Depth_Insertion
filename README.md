# Shallow-Depth Insertion

## 1) Oveview

This package is an implementation of **Shallow-Depth Insertion (SDI)**: a novel robotic manpulation technique suitable for assemmbling thin peg-like objects into a hole with a shallow dpeth, as can be seen in a cell phone battery insertion for example. Our technique features dexterous manipulation actions that combine into a complete insertion operation as seen in the animations below. This package is directly applicable to a simple hardware setting with the conventional parallel-jaw gripper installed on an industrial robot arm.
